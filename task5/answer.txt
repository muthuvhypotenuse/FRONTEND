Question 2

px (pixels) 
    a pixel is the absolute unit of measurement used to display an image or text on a screen.It is a fixed size, 
so 1px will always be the same physical size on any device. Pixels are commonly used for defining font sizes, 
borders, and spacing.

rem (root em) 
    a rem is a unit that is relative to the root font size of the document. By default, 
the root font size is typically 16px, so 1rem is equal to 16px. If the font size of the document is changed, 
Rems are often used for defining font sizes.

em (em-height)
    an em is a unit that is relative to the font size of the parent element. 
if the font size of the parent element is 16px, 1em would be equal to 16px. 
Ems are often used for defining font sizes and spacing.

% (percentage)
    a percentage is a unit that is relative to the size of the parent element.
if a child element has a width of 50%, it will be half the width of its parent element. 
Percentages are often used for defining widths, heights, and spacing.

vw (viewport width)
    a vw is a unit that is relative to the width of the viewport. 
1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
This unit is often used for defining widths and font sizes that need to scale with the viewport size.

vh (viewport height)
    a vh is a unit that is relative to the height of the viewport. 
1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
This unit is often used for defining heights and font sizes that need to scale with the viewport size.


Question 3

62.5% as font size to html element

    Setting the font size of the html element to 62.5% is a common practice in web design and development. 
This is because 62.5% is equal to 10px when the default font size of the browser is 16px. By setting the base font size to 10px, 
it becomes easier to calculate font sizes in rem units.
