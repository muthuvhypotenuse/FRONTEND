Props are passed down from a parent component to a child component. 
They are immutable, meaning that the child component cannot modify them. 
The parent component owns and controls the props, and it can update them by re-rendering the child component with different prop values. 
Props are useful for passing data or functions from a parent component to its child component, allowing for composition of complex UIs.

State, on the other hand, is used to manage data within a component. 
It is an object that represents the current state of the component and can be updated by the component itself. 
Whenever state is updated, the component is re-rendered with the new state value. 
State is used for managing component-specific data that changes over time, such as user input, 
fetched data, or UI states like open/closed modals or expanded/collapsed sections.

Try/catch blocks allow a program to handle an exception gracefully in the way the programmer wants them to. 
For example, try/catch blocks will let a program print an error message if it can't find an input file. 
Try blocks are the first part of try/catch blocks.

useState is a built-in React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. 
It is one of the most commonly used Hooks in React.

Before the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state management was only possible in class components. 
However, with useState, functional components can now also have state.
