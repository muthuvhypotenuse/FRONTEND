Question 


TypeScript is an open-source programming language that is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript.
 TypeScript provides several features that enhance the development experience of JavaScript, such as classes, interfaces,
 enums, and type annotations.

why developers choose to use TypeScript:

Type checking: TypeScript helps catch errors at compile-time instead of run-time by providing static type checking. 
This helps developers write safer and more reliable code.

Scalability: TypeScript allows developers to write large-scale applications more easily by providing features such as modules,
 namespaces, and interfaces.

Tooling: TypeScript has excellent tooling support with features such as code completion, type inference, and refactoring.
 This makes it easier for developers to write and maintain code.

Code readability: TypeScript's type annotations make code more self-documenting and easier to read, 
which can save time and effort during code reviews and debugging.

Future-proofing: TypeScript is constantly evolving and adding new features, which can help developers stay 
up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
