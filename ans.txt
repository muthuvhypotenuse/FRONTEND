Qustion 2
There are two types of components in React:

Class Components - these are more complex components that can have state and lifecycle methods. 
They are typically used for container components.

Function Components - these are simple components that take in props as input and return JSX elements. 
They are typically used for presentational components.


Qustion 3

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
